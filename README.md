# Pokedex-Quiz-Game

My first collaboration app! I reached out to a few random people on Reddit and we set up a small Discord server to learn how to build JavaScript applications. This was a great learning experience! Yeah, the code will be hilarious to look back on in a few years... I'm sure.

How to contribute ðŸ˜ƒ:
1. Clone the repository. 
I have found GitHub Desktop to be a very easy method for cloning repositories. You can download it here: https://desktop.github.com/  

(optional) Easy instructions for cloning the repository with GitHub Desktop: https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop

2. Open the newly cloned folder in VSCode. 
3. Make sure you "Fetch origin" before EVERY coding session, to ensure you have the latest code. You can do this via the Github desktop application. 
4. Once you have made a change that you feel should be committed to the main project, you should open a pull request so that we can review your code and merge it with the project. You can do this via Github Desktop.

Additional tip: You can install the "Live Server" extension in VSCode that will make it where your browser automatically updates your code as you edit it. Once installed, you can simply right-click on the index.html file in VSCode and choose "Open with Live Server".

We are using this "Coding 4 Babies" Discord server to collaborate on this project: https://discord.gg/prKJfUsQJq
